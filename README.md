# Shiny Modules

A collection of shiny modules that I might find useful later

## `datatable_module`
Creates a `DT` table that is editable with an add row button. This method makes use of the `editTable` function that was recently added to the package. `DT` probably has the most features of the various tables in shiny.

## `table_module`
Create a `rhandsontable` that is editable with an add row button. This method is more low level than the `DT` approach. I think the default handsontable has nicer formatting, but there are less features than `DT`.
